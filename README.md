# ChuckNorrisSendsSMS
Hi, my name is Lise, and I developped, designed, and deployed the app Chuck Norris Sends SMS in October 2019 as a side project while I was learning web development.

Chuck Norris Sends SMS uses:
Java and Spring MVC for the back-end.
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JSP, and JavaScript for the front-end.
Twilio SMS API to send texts.
The Internet Chuck Norris Database to generate the jokes.
The app is deployed on Heroku.
It even has form validation!

Have fun!
